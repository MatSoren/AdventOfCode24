# Advent of Code 2024 - Golang Solutions 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! 🚀 Here, I'll be uploading my solutions as I progress through the daily challenges at my own pace. This will be a great opportunity for me to deepen my understanding of **Golang** while tackling fun and thought-provoking problems.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Go 🦫
- **Paradigm:** Mostly functional + idiomatic Go
- **Goal:** Learning, experimenting, and having fun!

## 📌 Structure

Each day's solution will be placed under the `dayXX/` folder following a simple convention:

```
📂 day01/
    ├── input.txt   # Puzzle input
    ├── day01.go     # Go solution
```

## 🚀 Running the Solutions

To run a specific day's solution, simply navigate to the directory and execute:
```bash
go run . [-t] day01_Gold 
```
- If `-t` is provided, the algorithm runs **10,000 times**, generating three performance metrics:
  - **Average execution time**
  - **Total execution time**
  - **Worst execution time**


## 🌟 Why Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge that helps improve problem-solving skills while being an enjoyable and engaging experience. By using **Go**, I aim to solidify my knowledge of its syntax, concurrency model, and best practices.
